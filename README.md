# Welcome to Project peer prep created by g53!
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies are progressively shifting to online platforms for interviews. Traditional face-to-face interviews are being replaced with interviews conducted over platforms such as zoom, or MS Teams.
In order to provide aspiring programmers with a platform to practise and prepare for such technical interviews, our team has implemented a web application – PeerPrep.

PeerPrep is a web application that helps students prepare themselves for an online technical interview. This is done by simulating a technical interview setting to provide them with a rough gauge of what it is like to be in an actual interview. In addition, PeerPrep also helps students improve their technical and communication skills as they work together with others to solve programming problems. These are skills that employers will be looking out for during an actual interview as well.

Embark on your exciting journey of progress with us at Peer Prep today!
